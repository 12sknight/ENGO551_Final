# ENGO 551 Final Project
# Dog Tracking and Recreation
## By: Mitchell Brown, Zoe Walsh, Sam Knight

The purpose of this application is to provide 3 solutions:
1) Track your lost dog - Using your dogs last known GPS location
2) Find the closest dog park or water source while on a walk - Using the users phone location
3) Know if your dog has gotten enough exercise - Based on how far they have walked on a given day

As this project is built around the idea of using the app while you are out with your dog, we have made it mobile friendly so it can be used on a smartphone. When you first enter the site, you are presented with a map that contains all dog parks and fountains in Calgary. You have the ability to toggle these layers on and off as well.
