# ENGO 551 Final Project
# Dog Tracking and Recreation
## By: Mitchell Brown, Zoe Walsh, Sam Knight

The purpose of this application is to provide 3 solutions:
1) Track your lost dog - Using your dogs last known GPS location
2) Find the closest dog park or water source while on a walk - Using the users phone location
3) Know if your dog has gotten enough exercise - Based on how far they have walked on a given day
